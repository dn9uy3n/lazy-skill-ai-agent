# Lazy Skill AI Agent

A tool to manage AI skills **and rules** for **Claude Code**, **Antigravity**, and **Cursor**. Browse skills from multiple source directories and rule files, then add/remove them in your project through a visual interface.

Two versions are available:

- **[extension/](extension/)** — VS Code extension ([Install from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dn9uy3n.lazy-skill-ai-agent))
- **[app/](app/)** — Desktop application (standalone, runs on Windows / macOS / Linux)

## Skill Directory Structure

Both versions share the same skill directory convention:

```
my-skills/
├── commit/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── code-review/
│   └── code-review.md
└── feature-dev/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Each subdirectory is one skill. The `.md` file supports optional frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: commit
description: Auto-generate commit messages
---

# Content...
```

File lookup priority: `SKILL.md` → `{dir-name}.md` → first `.md` file.

When applied, the **entire skill folder** (markdown, scripts, helpers — everything) is copied into the workspace skills directory of the selected platform:

| Platform | Workspace Skills Folder |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `{project}/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/` |
| **Antigravity** | `{project}/.agent/skills/{skill-name}/` |
| **Cursor** | `{project}/.cursor/skills/{skill-name}/` |

The platform toggle at the top of the UI controls which folder is read from / written to. Switching platforms updates the install state of each skill in the list accordingly.

### Auto-generated skills index (`SKILL.md`)

After every Apply, an index file is generated at the **root of the skills folder** — for example `{project}/.claude/skills/SKILL.md`. It lists every installed skill with:

- **Title** (from the skill's `name` frontmatter)
- **When to use** (from the `description` frontmatter)
- **Location** (relative path to the skill's main `.md` file)

The purpose is to let an AI agent quickly discover the right skill without scanning every subfolder. The index is regenerated on each Apply and deleted automatically when no skills remain. Do not edit it manually — changes will be overwritten.

Example:

```markdown
# Skills Index

## Available skills

### commit
- **When to use:** Auto-generate commit messages from staged changes
- **Location:** `./commit/SKILL.md`

### review
- **When to use:** Review code for quality and potential issues
- **Location:** `./review/SKILL.md`
```

## Rule Files

In addition to skills, you can also manage **rule files** — single `.md` / `.mdc` / `.txt` files that get copied into the workspace's rules directory.

Add rule files individually via **+ Add Rule File** (multi-select supported), then check the rules you want included in the project.

| Platform | Workspace Rules Folder |
|----------|--------------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `{project}/.claude/rules/{rule-name}.md` |
| **Antigravity** | `{project}/.agents/rules/{rule-name}.md` |
| **Cursor** | `{project}/.cursor/rules/{rule-name}.md` |

> Note: Antigravity uses `.agent/skills/` (singular) for skills but `.agents/rules/` (plural) for rules — this matches Antigravity's own conventions.

A rule's name is taken from its frontmatter `name` field (or the filename if no frontmatter). The original file extension is preserved on install.

## Version 1: VS Code Extension

### Install from Marketplace (easiest)

Open VS Code / Antigravity → Extensions tab → search **"Lazy Skill AI Agent"**, or visit:

👉 https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dn9uy3n.lazy-skill-ai-agent

Or install from CLI:

```bash
code --install-extension dn9uy3n.lazy-skill-ai-agent
```

#### 🪐 Using Antigravity? Enable the Microsoft Marketplace first

Antigravity does not ship with the Microsoft VS Code Marketplace enabled by default. To install any extension from the Microsoft Marketplace (including this one), add the following entries to your Antigravity `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extensions.gallery.serviceUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery",
  "extensions.gallery.itemUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items"
}
```

**How to open `settings.json`:**

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type: **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**
3. Add the two lines above, save, and **restart Antigravity**

After restart, open the Extensions tab and search for **"Lazy Skill AI Agent"** — the extension will now appear and can be installed like on regular VS Code.

> ⚠️ Per Microsoft's marketplace terms, only Microsoft products (VS Code, Azure Data Studio, etc.) are officially allowed to use this gallery. Use at your own discretion.

### Build & Install from source

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run compile
npm run package       # Produces a .vsix file
```

Install into VS Code:
```bash
code --install-extension lazy-skill-ai-agent-0.1.0.vsix
```

Or via UI: **Extensions tab → `...` menu → Install from VSIX...**

For Antigravity:
```bash
antigravity --install-extension lazy-skill-ai-agent-0.1.0.vsix
```

### Development Mode

Open the project in VS Code → press `F5` → select the **"Run Extension"** launch config.

### Usage

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Lazy: Open Skill Manager**
